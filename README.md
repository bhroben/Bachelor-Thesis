## Abstract

The more metal-poor stars of the galactic halo and dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way offer a unique opportunity to shed light on population III stars. In this thesis, the main survey techniques and results are presented. Many of them come from recent studies of galactic archaeology in which high-resolution stellar spectroscopy is conducted to derive the chemical ab- bondances of very low-metallic stars. The two main groups of stars, C-rich and C-poor, classified on the basis of their different carbon content, are analysed. From a theoretical point of view, the observed chemical composition of the extremely metal-poor stars is compared with that which, according to simulations, corresponds to the material released by various types of supernovae. This comparison allows us to trace the properties of population III stars, from whose ashes the metal-poor stars were formed. The thesis also includes a discussion of alternative and complementary methods of investigation to galactic archaeology, which are based on the investigation of the universe at high redshift.
